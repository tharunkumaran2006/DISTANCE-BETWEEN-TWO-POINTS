# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation.
### Step 2:
Get the 2 points from the user.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  
![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance.
### Step 5:
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```
x1=10
x2=4
y1=6
y2=2
d=(pow((x2-x1),2)+pow((y2-y1),2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d**0.5))
```
